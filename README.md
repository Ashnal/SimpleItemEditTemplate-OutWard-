# SimpleItemEditTemplate-OutWard-
A Template for making simple changes to Items
you can either import the project into Visual Studio or View SimpleItemEditTemplate.cs and ScriptLoad.cs

I have used the Pistol Hand Cannon as my example and the aim is to give it -100 Magic Reduction because I am a dirty cheater.
